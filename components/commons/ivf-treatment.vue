                    Assisted Reproductive Technology offers new hope and possibilities for couple who would otherwise 
                    be unable to have children. In Vitro Fertilization or IVF involvesm stimulating the woman’s ovaries 
                    with fertility medication like gonadotropins to produce more number of eggs. These eggs when near to 
                    maturity are triggered with hCG injection, these eggs are then retrieved while the woman is under 
                    mild anesthesia. The eggs thus retrieved are fertilized with her husband’s sperm in the IVF lab.
                    <br>
                    The process of fertilization and embryo development are carefully monitored by an embryologist for
                    3-5 days. The resultant embryos are then thus transferred back to the woman’s womb in anticipation 
                    of a successful pregnancy. The decision to opt for an IVF procedure may be most challenging and 
                    difficult one a couple can make. We at Dr. Rama’s Institute for Fertility strive hard to see that 
                    each couple have individualized plan as per their requirements in order to maximize their chances 
                    of a having a successful pregnancy. Patience, individual attention, perseverance and emotional 
                    support is what we provide nexclusively at our place because of which our hospital is ranked among 
                    the best institutes not only in India but perhaps across the globe.

                Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection procedure has been a benefiting too many men who are trying to achieve 
                parenthood. For couples with prominent malefactors problems like low sperm count and low sperm motility, 
                this is the best treatment. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection or ICSI treatment is mostly successful for
                 men who are infertile and these are nearly used in IVF treatments. Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection 
                 needs only one sperm to inject directly into the egg. The fertilized egg i.e. embryo is then transferred 
                 to your womb (uterus).
