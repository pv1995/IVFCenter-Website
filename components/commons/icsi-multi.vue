                    IVF / ICSI Technology offers new hope and possibilities for couple who would otherwise be unable 
                    to have children. In Vitro Fertilization or IVF involves stimulating the woman’s ovaries with 
                    fertility medication like gonadotropins to produce more number of eggs. These eggs when near 
                    to maturity are triggered with hCG injection, these eggs are then retrieved while the woman is 
                    under mild anesthesia. The eggs thus retrieved are fertilized with her husband’s sperm in the 
                    IVF lab. The process of fertilization and embryo development are carefully monitored by an 
                    embryologist for 3-5 days. The resultant embryos are then thus transferred back to the woman’s 
                    womb in anticipation of a successful pregnancy.

                    The decision to opt for an IVF procedure may be most challenging and difficult one a couple can make. 
                    We at Dr. Rama’s Institute for Fertility strive hard to see that each couple have individualized plan 
                    as per their requirements in order to maximize their chances of a having a successful pregnancy.
                    <br><br>
                    Patience, individual attention, perseverance and emotional support is what we provide exclusively 
                    at our place because of which our hospital is ranked among the best institutes not only in India 
                    but perhaps across the globe.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Indications for IVF</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    IVF is generally recommended when simple treatments like IUI etc fail. When there is a tubal 
                    pathology or blockage, IVF remains the only way to help couple parent their own child.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Fallopian Tube Damage / Tubal factor</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    When there is a significant tubal damage the only options are surgical repair, or bypassing the 
                    role of fallopian tubes by opting for IVF. Sometimes even in cases where the fallopian tubes 
                    look healthy in the laparoscopy or hysterosalpingogram there can be mild infection which is 
                    not congenial for the fusion of spermatozoa and the eggs which can lead to infertility.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Anovulation</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    The majority of patients with an ovulation will conceive with simpler treatments. However 
                    patients requiring IVF are typically “high responders” to gonadotropin therapy and have good 
                    prognosis.

                <p class="treatment-content">
                    The advent of IVF process along with ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection pronounced as Iksee) 
                    the capacity to obtain fertilization in the IVF lab with severely abnormal sperm samples has 
                    revolutionized the options for couple having male infertility problems. It provides frontiers 
                    for men who were previously incapable of producing adequate sperm to father genetically related 
                    children.. ICSI is often recommended to couples having compromised semen parameters, either with 
                    motility, count, velocity, DNA, fragmentation, if spermatozoa are obtained surgically or if there 
                    has been a prior failure of fertilization.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Endometriosis</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    Endometriosis may be effectively treated with a combination of surgical and medical therapy. IVF 
                    is very effective as a second line of treatment if the initial lines of treatment have been 
                    unsuccessful.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Unexplained infertility</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    Approximately 20% of couples with infertility will have no identifiable cause of infertility after 
                    completing a comprehensive evaluation. It does not mean that there is no reason but implies that 
                    even in the modern scenario these causes cannot be diagnosed. IVF proves to be successful even 
                    in cases where the more conservative treatments have failed, especially because most of these 
                    couples actually have some block to fertilization, problems in fusion of egg and spermatozoa and 
                    further embryo development, movement of embryos from fallopian tube to its implantation site on 
                    the walls of the uterus.

                <p class="treatment-content">
                    A women’s ovarian function is diminished with age. Apart from the virtual age, there is something 
                    called as biological clock which keeps ticking away as the ovarian reserve of eggs keeps getting 
                    depleted. Insome this process is more rapid and can happen early on. Even in man with increasing 
                    age and exposure to pollutants or radiation there can be problems in the capacity of the spermatozoa 
                    to fertilize the egg on its own. In such cases these problems can be overcome through the use of IVF 
                    alone or in conjunction of this with techniques like ICSI, IMSI and Laser Assisted Hatching, PGD etc.
                </p>
                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis: – PGD</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    PGD or genetic testing may be indicated for patients who are at risk for genetic disorders like 
                    cystic fibrosis, thalassemia or breast cancer or for patients with infertility related chromosomal 
                    abnormalities such as recurrent IVF failure or recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).

                <p class="treatment-content">
                    In the female there may be severe compromise in the ovarian function like decreased ovarian function 
                    or fall in egg quality, in such cases egg donation from a donor who is capable of producing good quality 
                    eggs offers excellent chance of pregnancy. If male spouse is unable to produce spermatozoa capable the 
                    fertilizing an egg even with advanced techniques may also need to opt for sperm donation.
                    <br><br>
                    On the otherhand if the woman has problems in carrying the gestation to term either due to immune 
                    problems or medical problems like hypertension, abnormalities in the uterus or congenital problems 
                    where there is complete absence of the uterus, in such scenario the couple can still opt for a 
                    surrogate (host uterus) who will be a gestational mother for their child.

                <p class="treatment-content">
                    Men normally produce millions of sperm in each ejaculate. These sperm “swim” through the cervical 
                    opening and into the tubes to the site of fertilization. Some men have sperm defects such as a 
                    reduced sperm count, deformed sperm, or sperm that cannot swim effectively. When any one of these 
                    or a combination of these abnormalities are present, it can prevent normal fertilization. ICSI 
                    bypasses sperm defects because a single sperm is “selected” and placed inside the egg. ICSI is 
                    performed as a part of the IVF cycle.
                    <br><br>
                    ICSI involves the placement of a single sperm directly into the egg using a microscopic pipette, 
                    thus sperm and egg interactions involved with normal fertilization are by- passed. During IVF, 
                    the eggs are retrieved from the ovaries the surrounding cells are stripped off from the egg, best 
                    spermatozoa with morphology &amp; motility is selected & injected directly into the egg held held in 
                    position with a holding pipette. All the micromanipulations are done on an inverted microscope & 
                    micromanipulator. ICSI procedure ensures fertilization of the eggs upto 90%. ICSI has been 
                    successfully applied for the treatment of severe male infertility including suboptimal ejaculate 
                    samples, ejaculatory failure, obstructive and nonobstructive causes of azoospermia (complete 
                    absence of sperm).

                    The ICSI procedure involves stripping cells from around the egg and injecting a spermatozoon 
                    into the egg. A small percentage of eggs, often the less healthy eggs, may be damaged by these 
                    procedures and degenerate (5-10%).Sometimes eggs fail to fertilize normally or arrest at an 
                    early stage of development. ICSI procedure can thus be used to overcome these hurdles ICSI 
                    pregnancy rates and live birth rates are similar to those achieved with IVF.
                    <br><br>
                    Because some causes of male infertility are familial, and are related to genetic defects 
                    (e.g. Y-chromosome deletions) male offspring may inherit fertility problems. Therefore, 
                    patients with non-obstructive azoospermia or severe oligospermia (low sperm counts), who 
                    are likely candidates for genetic causes of infertility, should consider genetic counseling 
                    and karyotyping prior to ICSI.
                    <br><br>
                    In some cases, after ICSI embryos are co-cultured with follicular cells collected from the 
                    follicles during the egg aspiration to provide extra nourishment and remove any embryo- toxic 
                    factors that may be present.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Prior Vasectomy</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    Couples have the option of a vasectomy reversal or IVF-ICSI with epididymal or testicular 
                    sperm extraction. Age of the female partner and length of time since prior vasectomy are 
                    important factors in decision-making. It can sometimes take 6-9 months to recover adequate 
                    sperm counts following vasectomy reversal. Also, the greater the length of time between 
                    the vasectomy and the reversal, the greater the chances are that the surgery will be 
                    unsuccessful or that anti-sperm antibodies will form, preventing the recovered sperm 
                    from penetrating the eggs without IVF-ICSI. Spermatozoa for IVF-ICSI can be obtained 
                    with either Microsurgical Epididymal Sperm Aspiration (MESA) or Testicular Sperm 
                    Extraction (TESE).

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Microsurgical Epididymal Sperm Aspiration</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    In MESA procedure, under local anesthesia and general sedation, an incision is made in the 
                    scrotum, exposing the epididymis, the tubules immediately adjacent to the testicles that 
                    collect the sperm. Using an operating microscope, an incision is made into these tubules 
                    and sperm is aspirated. Although millions of motile sperm can often be collected, this 
                    sperm has not acquired the ability to penetrate an egg and must be injected into eggs via 
                    the IVF-ICSI technique. The advantage of MESA over TESE for men with obstructive azoospermia 
                    is that sperm collected in this manner can usually be frozen, and even if his partner has to 
                    undergo more than one IVF procedure, the MESA should provide adequate sperm for all subsequent 
                    IVF procedures. A TESE or testicular sperm extraction is a procedure that involves directly 
                    aspirating the sperm from the testes or obtaining sperm from a testicular biopsy. It is 
                    usually performed under local anesthesia block and can be done as an office surgical procedure. 
                    The disadvantage is that in many cases, testicular sperm is much more scarce and therefore 
                    difficult to freeze. Usually, there is only enough sperm recovered for one IVF procedure, and 
                    if further IVF attempts are needed, the TESE procedure will need to be repeated.

                <p class="treatment-content">
                    Men with very poor sperm production in the testicles and no sperm in the ejaculate often 
                    demonstrate high blood FSH levels and sometimes low testosterone levels. The testicular 
                    size may be small. These men are usually considered to have relative testicular failure. 
                    TESE or testicular biopsy is usually the only option for them as there are no sperm in the 
                    epididymis and even testicular sperm production can be “patchy” and scarce within the testes. 
                    Men with this diagnosis who have been told they have no sperm on routine testicular biopsy 
                    frequently can be found, on further investigation, to have sperm present in a scattered 
                    distribution within the testicle. If so, these areas can be re-aspirated for IVF-ICSI with 
                    some degree of success, depending on the amount of sperm obtained.

                <p class="treatment-content">
                    For the creation of a competent embryo two ‘partners’ are needed: a mature oocyte and a 
                    ‘good/healthy’ spermatozoon.
                    <br><br>
                    In the area of assisted reproduction, when we decide to do the classical in vitro fertilization 
                    we leave nature to choose the spermatozoa that will fertilize the available oocytes; on the 
                    contrary when we decide to do ICSI (in cases with male factor infertility) we have to choose 
                    the spermatozoa that we inject into the oocytes. For ICSI, after sperm preparation an optical 
                    magnification of 200x to 400x is used to examine the sample. The best ‘normal looking’ motile 
                    spermatozoa are selected based on their major morphology and then injected into oocytes retrieved 
                    after ovarian stimulation. With ICSI, even men with severe male factor infertility could possibly 
                    achieve pregnancy. However, despite 20 years of technological improvements, both clinical pregnancy 
                    and live birth rates remain relatively low at approximately 35% and 25% per started cycle, 
                    respectively.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore there is a kind of subjective selection, which is not adequately feasible due to the 
                    microscopic size of the spermatozoa. For the improvement of this selection a new innovative 
                    technique has been developed. The innovative technique is called IMSI (Intracytoplasmic 
                    Morphologically Selected sperm Injection) ‘motile sperm organelle morphology examination’ 
                    (MSOME). This technique requires the analysis of minor morphological criteria using ultra-high 
                    magnification ≥ 6000 times higher magnification when compared to the normal ICSI microscopy and 
                    it implies a powerful microscopy system which allows for the morphologic selection of the ‘good’ 
                    spermatozoon with strict criteria; morphology is associated with genetic quality of the spermatozoon 
                    and consequently with the creation of a good embryo. When using this technique, the motile sperm 
                    fraction is examined based on six subcellular organelles: acrosome, postacrosomal lamina, neck, 
                    mitochondria, tail, and nucleus. Even the minute defects in the spermatozoa become visibl under 
                    this powerful magnification like the size & shape of the head, vacuoles in the spermatozoa head 
                    the midpiece etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Studies comparing the IMSI and ICSI techniques indicate that IMSI does not improve fertilization 
                    rates or the morphologic quality of the embryos, but increases the pregnancy rates and reduces 
                    the miscarriage rates.
                    <br><br>
                    Couples with indication for IMSI are those with Sperm demonstrating high degree of DNA 
                    fragmentation and/or increased abnormal spermatozoa (teratozoospermia), conditions which 
                    often accompany oligoasthenospermia.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, IMSI may be beneficial for couples experiencing recurrent IVF failures and/or 
                    recurrent biochemicalpregnancies/miscarriages.
                    <br><br>
                    The promising results of IMSI lead us to adopt the technique in order to strengthen our goal 
                    which is to help our couples to have healthy children.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">PICSI</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    In the ICSI procedure, an individual sperm is selected and injected into an oocyte. Until now, 
                    the only technique available to embryologists to select the sperm has been visual observation. 
                    Using PICSI procedure we are able to determine sperm selection in much the same way it happens 
                    in human biology.
                    <br><br>
                    Sperms are placed in PICSI dish containing samples of hyaluronan hydrogel. Hyaluronan is a 
                    naturally occurring biopolymer found in all human cells, including the gel layer surrounding 
                    the oocyte.
                    <br><br>
                    Mature, biochemically competent sperm bind to the hyaluronan where they can be isolated by the 
                    embryologist and used for ICSI. This procedure mimics a key step in the natural fertilization 
                    process, the binding of mature sperm to the oocyte complex. As a result, the selected sperm is 
                    essentially the same as one that would be successful in the natural reproductive process.
                    <br><br>
                    The research proved that hyaluronan-bound PICSI-selected sperm are, in the vast majority of cases, 
                    more mature, exhibit less DNA damage, and have fewer chromosomal aneuploidies.
                    <br><br>
                    We consider the PICSI method to be a biologically more natural and effective form of fertilization 
                    in comparison to ICSI, because only those sperm are chosen for fertilization that are able to form 
                    a bond with the oocyte cumulus complex, i.e. only mature sperm are selected.
                    <br><br>
                    This method is suitable for everyone but we highly recommend it especially in the following cases:

                <p class="treatment-content">
                    The human embryo has an outer shell called as the zone pellucida. This layer sometimes is either 
                    thickened or hardened due to various reasons, like advanced maternal age, elevated FSH levels, 
                    PCOS or sometimes due to suboptimal cultural conditions hereditary etc. In such cases the embryo 
                    cannot hatch on its own to implant on the walls of the uterus and thus could lead to implantation 
                    failure, thereby causing infertility.
                    <br><br>
                    This scenario can be compared to the seed. When we need the seed to germinate we soak it in water such that when the water seeps in the force is sufficient to break the outer seed coat and germination occurs, same is with human embryo too.
                    <br><br>
                    Assisted Hatching is generally performed on a cleavage stage embryos either on day 2, day 3 or day 5 of invitro culture, prior to transferring them back to the patient’s womb.
                    <br><br>
                    We at Dr.Rama’s Institute For Fertility use the latest cutting edge laser technology available today to provide our patients with safest, fastest and uniform way of Laser Assisted Hatching.
                    <br><br>
                    In this technique the outer shall of the embryo is breached with few laser pulses of very low intensity to create holes in the zona pellucida thus making it thin. As the embryo develops further to the blastocyst having >150 cells the pressure from with in will be sufficient to facilitate hatching of the zona pellucida giving way for the embryo to implant on the walls of the uterus successfully.
                    <br><br>
                    This procedure just takes a few seconds per embryo to be completed. It thus helps to overcome failure due to failed hatching.

                    Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or PGS Preimplantation Genetic Screening is a screening test used to determine if genetic or chromosomal disorders are present in embryos produced through in vitro fertilization (IVF). Preimplantation genetic diagnosis screens embryos before they are transferred to the uterus so couples can make
                    informed decisions about their next steps in the IVF process. Embryos unaffected by the genetic or chromosomal disorder can be selected for transfer to the uterus.

                    The benefit of preimplantation genetic diagnosis is that the diagnosis can be made before the embryos are transferred to the uterus and a pregnancy is established.

                    After the biopsy and following receipt of the results from the genetic/chromosomal testing, embryo(s) of the best quality that are not affected by the genetic disorder or chromosomal abnormality) are selected for transfer to the uterus. For day 3 embryo biopsies, the embryo is usually transferred “fresh” following two additional days of culture in the laboratory (Day-5 embryo transfer). In some cases, the biopsy will be done on either Day-5 or -6 (trophectoderm biopsy). At this stage, the embryo consists of many cells and is called a blastocyst. Cells are removed from the outer layer of cells called the trophectoderm.
                    <br><br>
                    Following the biopsy of a good quality blastocyst, the blastocyst is then frozen. When the patient receives the results from the genetic testing, the non-affected or chromosomally normal blastocyst(s) are thawed and transferred in a subsequent frozen embryo cycle.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Testing for heritable genetic disorders</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is performed on the biopsied cell(s) to determine the presence of a single gene. This is done when a couple has a significantly increased risk of conceiving a child with a severe genetic disorder. When PCR is to be performed, the cell(s) obtained at biopsy is loaded into a tiny tube of medium and sent to for analysis. The specific area of DNA of interest is amplified by making thousands of copies of the DNA through repeated cycles of DNA strand separation and replication. The sample can be analyzed for the presence of a specific sequence of DNA or gene and also for linkage markers near the gene. The biopsied cell(s) are destroyed during this process. Therefore, they cannot be used for another purpose or returned to the embryo.
                </p>
                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Testing for chromosomal abnormalities</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    The genetic material (DNA) within the biopsied cell(s) is amplified using a technique called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This amplification produces enough DNA to use a second technique, known as array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Array CGH assesses the amount of DNA derived from each chromosome, revealing whether or not there are both a normal amount and correct number of chromosomes. The biopsied cell(s) are destroyed during this process. Therefore, they cannot be used for another purpose or returned to the embryo. aCGH can be used to screen for numeric abnormalities in all chromosomes and/or known rearrangements of chromosomes (translocations). Array CGH does not detect all types of chromosome aberrations or genetic mutations and cannot distinguish between no translocation present and balanced translocation present.
                    <br><br>
                    The results of preimplantation genetic diagnosis are reported to the couple no later than the morning of their scheduled day for embryo transfer. Typically this is five days after oocyte retrieval and in vitro fertilization are performed. Of the embryo(s) that are not affected by the genetic disorder or chromosomal abnormality, the best quality embryo(s) are selected for transfer to the uterus. If additional unaffected and good-quality embryos are available, they may be cryopreserved for a future embryo transfer.
                    <br><br>
                    Preimplantation genetic diagnosis does not replace prenatal testing, such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis provides diagnostic information based on the analysis of a single cell. Therefore, prenatal testing is still recommended and currently remains the standard of care.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Blastocyst Transfer</h5>
                <div class="treatment-content">
                    A blastocyst is an embryo that has been developed in the laboratory for five or six days after insemination, in contrast to conventional IVF which involves transferring embryos to the womb two to three days after egg collection and insemination (this is referred to as a Day 2 or 3 transfer).
                    <br><br>
                    <ul class="treatment-list">
                        <li>With a blastocyst transfer, the embryo has advanced to the five or 6-day stage.</li>
                        <li>This means the embryo has divided many more times into many more cells over this period. Blastocysts have a very thin outer shell thus potentially increasing the chances of implantation into the uterine cavity. Most of the blastocyst contains a fluid cavity and it is possible to see the cells which will become the baby and those which will make up the placenta.</li>
                        <li>The cells in a blastocyst have just started to differentiate The surface cells that surround the cavity (just under the outer shell) are called the trophectoderm and will later develop into the placenta A more centrally located group of cells – the inner cell mass, will become the fetus.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    While the majority of fertilised eggs will develop into a three-day old embryo, only perhaps 40% of these embryos will develop into a blastocyst. Therefore, blastocysts are considered to be a more “select” group of embryos with a higher chance of pregnancy.
                    <br><br>
                    The 5 or 6 day blastocyst is a much more advanced structure than the 3 day old embryo and the real advantage of transferring blastocysts is the high live birth rate associated with blastocyst transfer.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Why Blastocyst Transfer</h5>
                <br><br>
                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Selection of embryos</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">We know that at least 50% (or higher in women over 40) of embryos are not viable, and many of these arrest their development before the blastocyst stage. A large proportion of these embryos have a chromosome or genetic defect and it is believed that those embryos that failed to develop to the blastocyst would not, in any event, have established a pregnancy. Where there are large numbers of good quality embryos available at the blastocyst stage these can be frozen. DRIFF has excellent post thaw survival and pregnancy rates with frozen blastocysts.</p>
                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Extended in-vitro culture systems</h5>
                <ul class="treatment-list">
                        <li>In the past, it was difficult to get high quality blastocysts with in vitro culture systems – unless “feeder” cells were utilized – called coculture.</li>
                        <li>THowever, since 1998 more advanced culture media have been commercially available that (if used properly) can yield high blastocyst formation rates. Now blastocyst embryo transfer is a viable IVF treatment option for many couples.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Embryos are transferred to the right place at the right time</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">Some researchers believe that the conditions in the womb may be more optimal for a blastocyst than a day 2/3 embryo as there are slightly differing conditions in the fallopian tube and the womb on day 2/3.</p>
                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Higher pregnancy rate in women having Blastocyst Transfer</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">Data suggests that blastocyst transfer can increase the chances of a live birth but it needs to be remembered that each couple must be considered independently.</p>
                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Confirmation of development to the blastocyst stage</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">Our specialists believe that for those patients who have recurrent failure of implantation, extended culture gives an opportunity to examine the embryo quality over a longer period. If the embryos arrest or become fragmented this may help to clarify a potential problem.</p>
                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Specific situations where blastocyst transfer is applicable</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">Where single embryo transfer is specifically indicated (eg. previous history of multiple pregnancy, patient preference, uterine anomaly etc) blastocyst transfer may be a particularly useful option.</p>
                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">Extended culture and Blastocyst Transfer with Frozen Embryos</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    Some patients have large numbers of frozen embryos and it can difficult to know which have the best potential for pregnancy. An option in these cases is to thaw all embryos and culture through to the blastocyst stage to allow the best 1 or 2 embryos to be replaced based on development.
                    <br><br>
                    The main benefit of the blastocyst transfer approach is in the ability to discriminate between different embryos in terms of their quality and implantation potential. It is essential to understand that the extended culture process doesn’t enhance an embryos quality per se; it is principally a method for choosing the ‘front runner’ or ‘runners’ from a group of embryos.
                    <br><br>
                    It is important that we carefully choose the patients who are most likely to benefit. Our general guideline is to proceed to blastocyst transfer only if there are 4 or more good quality embryos available on day 3.

                <h5 class="treatment-subheading">EMBRYOSCOPE, INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR YOUR DREAM</h5>
                <p class="treatment-content">
                    The EmbryoScope™ is an IVF incubator with a built-in camera for automated time-lapse imaging of fertilized oocytes in a safe incubation environment from conception until the time of transfer. Preliminary studies showed that it can increase up to 20% the chance of success of assisted reproductive technology. Definitely one of the key factors in the success of a medical assisted procedure is the opportunity to continuously follow the stages of embryo development and, therefore, to choose the most appropriate time for its implantation in the uterus, with the best guarantees for a peaceful pregnancy.
                    <br><br>
                    Embryoscope ™ is one of the most technologically advanced and innovative devices available to the assisted reproduction centers. It is a system that integrates a multi-gas incubator, a microscope with an integrated camera shooting continuous image and an advanced software for the acquisition and subsequent analysis of all data relating to the development of embryos. It’s the only instrument in the world documenting with this flexibility all stages of the process, automatically, without opening the incubator: it therefore operates in a completely safe and non-invasive manner. The characteristics of this device allow the embryologist constantly monitoring the conditions of the embryos and to act in the best way to ensure the highest chance of success. The Embryoscope also opens new and important perspectives from the point of view of clinical research. Its ability to store in a continuous and unique manner of the morphological characteristics of the embryo during every stage development, allows developing more precise and effective criteria for evaluating the potential implantation of individual embryos.The next evolution of the instrument will be able to create a predictive algorithm, which will provide the embryologist with further and useful indications to choose the embryo to implant.
